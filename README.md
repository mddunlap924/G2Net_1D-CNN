# G2Net Gravitational Wave Detection â€“ 1D CNN



This is code I developed for the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/overview). Thanks to teammates [Johnny Lee](https://www.kaggle.com/wuliaokaola), [Alex](https://www.kaggle.com/lihuajin), and [Coolz](https://www.kaggle.com/cooolz) we were able to finish in 10th position out of 1,219 teams (i.e., top 1%) through creative problem solving and advanced solutions.

The objective of this competition was to determine if a linear sine-sweep signal, also referred to as a chirp waveform, was either present or not in a data instance. The challenge is that the chirp waveform would have a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is a one, if not the most, informative measures of signal detectability.
