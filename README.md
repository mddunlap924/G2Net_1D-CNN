# G2Net Gravitational Wave Detection â€“ 1D CNN



This is code I developed for the [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/overview). Thanks to teammates [Johnny Lee] (https://www.kaggle.com/wuliaokaola), [Alex] (https://www.kaggle.com/lihuajin), and [Coolz] (https://www.kaggle.com/cooolz)

The objective of this competition was to determine if a linear sine-sweep signal, also referred to as a chirp waveform, was either present or not in a data instance. The challenge is that the chirp waveform would have a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is a one, if not the most, informative measures of signal detectability.
